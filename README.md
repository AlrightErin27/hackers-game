### User Story:

- The opening page will "load" and they read opening info about the game. The user is asked to input the
  their coding pen name.
- Once the user is in, they see the game screen. The game screen will have a coding problem that
  is written in JS and they choose from a optional choice answer below.
- When they get the answer wrong they are greeted by a pop up that leads them to start over.
- When they get the answer correct they move on to the next of 5 questions, while the score is still
  shown on the left of the screen.
- If all 5 questions are correct, the user is shown a leader board that will save their name and score.
